MEDICAL EMERGENCY NOTES: 
Cystic Fibrosis (Pancreatic Deficient) moderate
Asha will sometimes cough as a symptom of congestion in her lungs from CF - it is not contagious. 
 Asha needs to have her water bottle available to drink regularly.  
Asha may also use an inhaler to relieve chest tightness and wheeze which is related to CF. 
CF impacts on digestion, and at times Asha may need to leave the class quickly to go to the toilet.
At times Asha will be moving classes just out of the rush times, as she will be on medication that is attached to her body that could be knocked.
First aid precautions
On hotter days and/or doing a lot of exercise, Asha must keep hydrated, please monitor, and get her to rest with some water as needed.
If there is a lot of blood in Asha's sputum from coughing, send with a friend to student central.  Parent to be contacted, if not contactable, to call an ambulance.
If there are students with colds/ influenza in your class, keep students away from Asha to reduce her chance of hospitalisation.
If Asha is looking more tired than usual, encourage her or send her with a friend to student central to rest/ go home.

MEDICAL EMERGENCY NOTES: 
see plan for ADHD

----------------------------
MEDICAL CONDITION DESCRIPTION: 
**Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)

MEDICAL EMERGENCY NOTES: 
Tash needs to use things to fidget with, either a squishy toy, or a water type squeezable toy
Tash often needs to take a break if her anxiety level gets to much for her within her class, and she will use her 'get out of class' pass
Tash needs extra teacher assistance with having instructions explained and will also require the teacher to check on her to help her with staying on task
Tash struggles with large groups of students and will continue to sit in Student Central during breaks as required
Tash does get distracted and she is aware of this, and she will use different things to help her stay on task, either flicking or playing with a hair tie, or a pen, 
She may need to be reminded to choose another item to fidget with

Tash doesn't like people knowing about this condition, and we would like the teaching staff to use discretion when speaking to her about things
I will also forward the Psychiatrist letter to be included in her medical file

If Tash becomes overwhelmed in a social situation, she needs to be able to leave the situation and get herself into a clam space, best with no other students or staff around, except staff she feels comfortable with, (Chris Belke, Emily Donders) 

Tash will become verbally upset very quickly and often without warning, if something happens that upsets her or she is extremely disappointed
Part of this disorder, is that Tash cant control her emotions and has no self regulator, which is something that we have all learned a bit too late, as a lot of the peer group now judge her and will have nothing to do with her, as she has responded in an inappropriate manner in the past.
This has caused the social anxiety and general anxiety disorder to get out of hand.

Sertraline 200mg/day takes at home before school
